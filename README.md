# VUE.js crash 2024:

Some VUE.js practice, from [Vue.js Crash Course 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeNfHj6MhgA) by TraversyMedia.

- See the basic of Vue API preference options:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41dfa1d6-e99a-4def-b3f5-ac9ee9c87242)

-> You can take a look at `App2.vue` file.

- See the basic of Vue API preference composiiton and lifecycle methods:

-> You can take a look at `App3.vue` and  `App4.vue` file.

- Create an app of jobs, where I see these concepts:

```
- defineProps (to pass props to a component)
- slot (similar to children of React)
- bind
- ref
- computed (similar to dependency array of useEffect hook)
- vue-router: RouterView, createRouter, createWebHistory, RouterLink, useRoute, not-found route, dynamic routes with :id. 
```

## TECHNOLOGIES:

```

```

## COMMANDS

1. Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

2. Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

And see it running at: [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)


```sh
npm run server
```

To run the JSON-Server at port 5000, and use the endpoints:

GET JOBS LIST: [http://localhost:5000/jobs](http://localhost:5000/jobs)

3. Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
